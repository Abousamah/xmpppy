                Introduction to xmpppy.

    This is my work to replace http://xmpppy.sf.net/ with the current and maintained
project.
    Documentation exists in three formats.
    - The first is the examples that written to show xmpppy in action. This is
      two simple scripts - README.py and xsend.py.
    - The second is the html pages where describing the idea of library
      and the ways the goals are achieved.
    - Third is the docstrings. Using epydoc but other tools
      should work too (at least the pydoc works)

                Installation

Here you have several options:
  - run 'python setup.py install' from xmpppy distribution as root.
    All should work nice.
  - if you don't like python installator - just copy xmpp directory into python's
    site-packages directory (this is what setup.py does).
  - If you have no intention to install library system-wide (or just have no
    privileges to do it) you can copy xmpp directory just in your application's
    directory. Example:
        myxmpppytry/
            xmpp/
                ...xmpppy modules
            test.py

If you have any questions about xmpppy usage or you have find a bug or want
to share some ideas - you are welcome on github
